Rise up from the fire, take back all authority
Let go of all that holds you down
Made up enemies imprison your identity
And soon your soul turns into stone

Start from within
This is the day we begin to break away

(Face the storm and break) away
(Set the course and) find your way
(Realize it's time) to change your point of view and rise
Your time has come, synergize now

In the dead of night your heart keeps pounding in your chest
The monster sleeping by your side
Stealing sanity from your manic manifest
There's no place left for you to hide

Start from within
This is the day we begin to break away

(Face the storm and break) away
(Set the course and) find your way
(Realize it's time) to change your point of view and rise
Your time has come, synergize now

Revise, arise from the lows
It's time to come out of your cage
Live in shadows
There's nowhere left to hide
Your sorrow, all time is by your side

Revise, arise from the lows
It's time to let go of your rage and rise

Start from within
Feel free of what holds you down
This is the day we begin to break away

(Face the storm and break) away
(Set the course and) find your way
(Realize it's time) to change your point of view and rise
Your time has come, synergize now

Don't take all our time for granted
It could all be gone tomorrow
Do not drown your pain in sorrow
Try to live today

Rise, rise from the lows, rise
Rise, rise from below, rise

Light as a feather, all worries gone
My soul yearns to be free
I'm wandering towards the sun
Lost in mourning, my heart is longing
Living in a paradox of synergy
