Oh, you
I’ve heard the things that ya think
More like I guessed cause I’ve been there
I can see it on your face
You need to recreate
So what’s your vision? Watcha living for?
Yeah
Ooh
Open up every door in your heart you slammed
shut
Ooh
Then you’ll feel the spark
Fan the flames
Ignite even in dark
No ones gonna catch you
You’re falling and so bruised
It’s up to you, so go choose
If you’ll keep on crawling, darling
All that it takes is this
(Listen up now)
Live, let live and start again it’s
Up to you not destiny
Scrape your knees and when you bleed
Know pain means your alive and free
World is turning, you can’t sleep
Breathing’s not always easy
I know you’re not fine
Life’s a mess, I relate
Beauty mixed with pain
So, won’t you stay? Yeah
Don’t let me down
Don’t let me down
Don’t need perfect, the world keeps turning
Don’t let you down
Don’t let you down
When you fall those scars are worth it
No ones gonna catch you
You’re falling and so bruised
It’s up to you, so go choose
If you’ll keep on crawling, darling
All that it takes is this
(Listen up now)
Live, let live and start again it’s
Up to you not destiny
Scrape your knees and when you bleed
Know pain means your alive and free
You’re the key key key
To your reality
(live, let live and start again, yeah)
You can be be be
Just who you wanna be
(Manifesting every dream)
You’re a dream come true
Know that nothing, no one else can compare to
you
You’re the match and fuse, so light it up, make
a new you
Live, let live and start again it’s
Up to you not destiny
Scrape your knees and when you bleed
Know pain means your alive and free
